# TODO (Roadmap)

This file tracks planned work items for SimRaceStrategist.
The project is under active development; priorities may change.

Legend:

- ✅ done
- 🚧 in progress
- 🧪 experimental
- ⏳ planned

---

## NOW (Stabilize the core)

### Telemetry & Data Pipeline

- ✅ Add a "data health" panel/log summary:
    - ✅ CSV import status (last file, last parse time)
    - ✅ UDP status (connected, last packet age, port)
    - ✅ DB write status (last insert/update)
- ✅ Improve CSV robustness:
    - ✅ handle missing/renamed columns gracefully
    - ✅ validate multi-block structure
    - ✅ better error messages (file + block + reason)
- 🚧 Add basic data retention tools:
    - ✅ clear cache button
    - ⏳CLI option
    - ✅ DB export (CSV) for debugging

### Minisectors (F1 25)

- ✅ Stabilize lap start detection (MS01 edge cases)
- ✅ Add a minisector debug dump (per lap snapshot) to log
- ✅ Add a per-track minisector sanity checker:
    - missing indices
    - unusual splits (too small/too large)

### Rain / Strategy Core

- 🚧 Live race strategy reacting to:
    - weather changes
    - Safety Car / VSC phases
    - pit loss vs. pace delta evaluation
- 🚧 Expose RainEngine decision details in UI/log:
    - wetness score
    - confidence
    - reasons (signals used)
    - fix PIT STOP recommendation bug
- ⏳ Add safeguards for early-session low-sample situations
  (confidence gating / “collecting data” state)

---

## NEXT (User-facing strategy output)

### Linux Support

- ⏳ adding support for linux distros

### Strategy UI

- ⏳ Calculate strategy based on selected team context
    - pit loss model
    - tyre behavior differences
- ⏳ Consider opponent strategies and gaps
    - defensive pit stops (e.g. Inter → Wet if gap allows)
    - undercut / overcut awareness
- ⏳ Replace placeholder Strategy Cards with real outputs
    - Plan A/B/C from strategy core + DB stats
    - show confidence + short reasoning
- ⏳ Add "Recommendation" header:
    - BOX / STAY OUT
    - target tyre
    - box-in lap estimate
- ⏳ Integrate SC/VSC effect into pit window calculation
    - reduced pit loss
    - rejoin position estimation
    - live evaluation using UDP + DB pace

### Degradation / Pit Windows

- ⏳ Integrate degradation estimates into strategy cards:
    - max stint estimate
    - 1-stop / 2-stop feasible windows
- ⏳ Mark and exclude inlaps/outlaps/outliers in UI
  (already supported by analysis logic; needs presentation)
- 🚧 Use condition SHIFT detection in degradation model
    - exclude laps after strong condition changes from dry-fit
- 🚧 Prefer minisector (or at least sector) data over full lap times
    - allow partial laps (e.g. outlaps without pit minisectors)

### Safety Car Decisions

- ⏳ Add SC panel:
    - Box / Stay / Opposite recommendation
    - estimated delta / pit-loss model
    - basic risk tags (traffic, track position)

### UI & Output quality

- ⏳ Convert lap times from ss.ms to m:ss.ms consistently in UI
- ⏳ Display Stint ID in UI
    - e.g. "Stint 2 – Lap 5"
- 🚧 Show minisector times with color coding
    - green / yellow / purple (🚧 green not there because no opponent times)
- 🚧 more intuitive UI for easier use
    - flags being displayed as icon
    - session timing data
        - lap time
        - minisectors
        - delta
        - other
            - speed
            - tyres
            - weather
            - etc.

### Driver & Data Selection

- ⏳ Allow selecting individual drivers
- ⏳ Automatically highlight the most relevant driver times
    - closest rivals
    - strategy-relevant cars
    - cars changing from e.g. Slick to Inter purple times

---

## LATER (Expansion & polish)

### Multi-Game Support

- 🧪 Add F1 24 profile (then step-by-step down to F1 2017)
    - 🧪 add F1 2020 profile
- ⏳ Compatibility layer for missing UDP features in older games
- ⏳ Optional manual track profiles:
    - track length overrides
    - sector boundary overrides (for older games)

### Track & Metadata Coverage

- ⏳ Extend track ID mapping
- ⏳ Track-specific preset baselines (optional)

### Weather forecast expansion

- ✅ Interpret "next lap" from minute-based forecast samples
    - map minutes → laps using estimated lap time

### Multiple OS Support

- ⏳ adding support for Android devices

### Quality of Life

- ⏳ Installer / portable build
- ⏳ Auto-update check
- ⏳ Better logging controls (verbosity levels)
- ⏳ Showing explicit words for weather etc. instead of number
- ⏳ Add audio output for key strategy events
    - open pit window (“Box box box”)
    - weather / rain threshold reactions
    - Safety Car / VSC state changes

### AI implementation

- ⏳ AI-assisted strategy logic
    - higher-level decision-making
    - scenario evaluation
    - long-term race outcome estimation

---

## Known Limitations (by design / current scope)

- Minisector accuracy varies by game:
    - F1 25: native minisectors
    - older titles: approximation/fallback where necessary

---

## Definition of Done (for features)

A feature is considered "done" when:

- it does not break existing functionality
- it logs useful debug info on failure
- it has a minimal UI output OR clear CLI/log output
- it is documented briefly in CHANGELOG / README if user-visible
